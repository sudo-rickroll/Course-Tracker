## Course-Tracker
This is an application built to maintain an inventory of courses. It is built using React.js on the frontend and Express.js on the backend, with MongoDB being the database and Mongoose being the ODM. The frontend is built and statically served from the `dist` folder. However, the directory `frontend` also has the development build of the frontend code for purposes of illustration.

The demonstrative version of the application is hosted [here](https://course-tracker-mw6v.onrender.com/)

Some features like viewing course tabs, updating/deleting courses, and sorting only appear once you are logged in. You can only edit or delete courses that are uploaded by you. For the rest, you can just view or like the courses.
